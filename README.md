# HTMX Playground

This is a learning repo for me to test stuff with [HTMX](https://deploy-preview-1650--htmx.netlify.app). 
The underlying server is run by [Actix-Web](https://actix.rs).

## How to run

Just run `cargo run`.

For auto-reloading run `cargo watch -x run`. For this [cargo-watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch) must be installed.
